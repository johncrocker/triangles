### User Story

**Description:**
As a Student of Mathematics
I want to determine the type of triangle from three numbers that will represent each side of a triangle
So that I can pass my mathematics exam

**Team Notes:**
* Invalid lengths should be rejected, such as zero and negative values.
* The application must accept three integer inputs representing the length of each side
* It must return a Enum value to indicate the type of triangle, this should be one of "Scalene, Isosceles, Equilateral"
* Unit tests must be provided to meet the definition of done
* The triangle is deemed to exist in two dimensional space

**Acceptance Criteria:**
* AC1. Demonstrate through unit tests the working function.
* AC2. Demonstrate through unit tests the rejection of invalid lengths.
* AC3. The triangle is correctly identified.

Definition of Done
The code must be complete and runnable
Unit tests must be supplied and must execute successfully
